First letter of string:
=======================

Uniqueness: This is not very unique at all; any words that begin with with the same letter will have the same signature.
Brevity: The signature is very short; it is always a single character.
Efficiency: signature() can be implemented in O(1) time
Order-preservation: This signature is order preserving.

Concatenation of ascii codes:
=============================

Uniqueness: This signature is unique; there are no two words with the same signature.
Brevity: The signature is not necessarily brief; it increases in length with the length of the word.
Efficiency: signature() can be implemented in O(n) time
Order-preservation: This signature is not order preserving.
