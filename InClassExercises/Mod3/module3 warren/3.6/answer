A full, complete, and balanced binary tree has 2^i nodes at level i.
If it's height is h, then the total number of nodes is given by the
summation sum( i = 0, h, 2^i ) = (2^(i+1))-1.

By reversing the above equation, you know that in this tree of height h,
there are n = log(h+1)-1. This value of n is always less than log(n), and a 
balanced binary tree will never have more than that many nodes, so
the height of a balanced binary tree is O(log n).


A similar ternary tree has 3^i nodes at level i. At height h, the total
number of nodes is given by the summation
sum( i = 0, h, 3^i ) = ((3^(h+1))-1)/2. By reversing this equation, we know
that the height of a ternary node with n nodes is h = log3(2n+1)-1.
