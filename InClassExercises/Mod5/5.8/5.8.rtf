5.8 PageRank\'a0is an\'a0algorithm\'a0used by\'a0Google Search\'a0to rank websites in their search engine results.\'a0 PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is.\'a0 The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.\'a0 The PageRank Algorithm was easily manipulated by website owners.\'a0 They focused on increasing their rank by having certain links on the site, instead of improving content.}
